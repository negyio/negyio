I considered how Negy support the `http` as proxy, but instead, support `https` only. That\'s because the real world web pages basically support `https` and Negy should focus on it.\\n- https://github.com/negyio/negy/issues/27\\n\\n### Filtering nodes by network name!\\n\\nThis is a first step of the long journey. Currently Negy support the filtering by \\"original\\" network name. In the near future, this will be more abstract. (Thanks [Darth-Ness](https://github.com/Darth-Ness)!)\\n- https://github.com/negyio/negy/pull/26\\n\\n### Display removing reason on node pool\\n\\nFor the debugging reason, node pool now shows removing reason. This does not weaken security.\\n- https://github.com/negyio/negy/pull/30\\n\\n### Node sends context at once\\n\\nPreviously, node send its context twice. First, send its public key, and then, send its version. But this makes unstable behaviour. The bug was reported by [Trac3D1y](https://github.com/I2rys).\\n- https://github.com/negyio/negy/issues/31\\n- https://github.com/negyio/negy/pull/32\\n\\n## Document Improvement\\n\\nThere are several document improvement\\n- [Create Negy\'s full network by building source code](https://negy.io/docs/contribution/development_contribution/#by-building-source-code)\\n\\n## Others\\n- Negy got new icon!\\n- 31 stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/negyio/negy)\\n- 46 upvotes and 63 followers on [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/negy)\\n- 5.3k views on [reddit r/onions](https://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/y9o0ic/negy_im_building_a_proxy_that_conceals_your/)\\n- 3.8k views on [reddit r/rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/yccpoi/negy_next_generation_anonymous_internet/)\\n- 16 followers on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/negyio)"},{"id":"version-0-1-1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/version-0-1-1","source":"@site/blog/2022-11-02-version-0-1-1/index.md","title":"Version 0.1.1","description":"Announce version 0.1.1","date":"2022-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 2, 2022","tags":[],"readingTime":1.3,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Taichiro Suzuki","title":"Founder of Negy","url":"https://github.com/tbrand","imageURL":"https://github.com/tbrand.png","key":"tbrand"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Version 0.1.1","description":"Announce version 0.1.1","slug":"version-0-1-1","authors":["tbrand"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Version 0.1.2","permalink":"/blog/version-0-1-2"},"nextItem":{"title":"Negy\'s official Twitter account!","permalink":"/blog/start-twitter-account"}},"content":"Today I\'m excited to announce Negy\'s new version 0.1.1!\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## New features\\n\\n### Add filtering of versions\\n\\nNow gateway able to filter the node\'s versions by `--min-version=x.x.x`. It really useful for compatibility consideration and not choosing nodes which vulnerabilities are left unchecked. I would also like to congratulate the first external contributor for being merged. (Thanks [Darth-Ness](https://github.com/Darth-Ness)!)\\n- https://github.com/negyio/negy/pull/18\\n- https://github.com/negyio/negy/pull/22\\n\\n### Gateway authentication\\n\\nNow gateway able to authenticate the access. This is useful for operating private gateways located in public places. This ensures that even if the url is known, others cannot use the gateway with the authenticate token.\\n\\nIf you want to activate the authentication, execute the gateway by the command below. (Replace the `MY_AUTH_TOKEN` to whatever you want.)\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker run -it tbrand:negy-gateway --auth-token=MY_AUTH_TOKEN\\n```\\n\\nAfter the launch, access to the gateway via\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl https://example.com -x http://MY_AUTH_TOKEN@localhost:3000\\n```\\n\\nIt uses basic authentication feature, so if you want to configure it on you GUI, put the token in the username and leave the password blank.\\n\\n## Document Improvement\\n\\nThere are several document improvement.\\n- [Added \\"How to configure Negy on Windows\\"](https://github.com/negyio/negyio.github.io/pull/3)\\n- [Other improvement (including fixing typos)](https://github.com/negyio/negyio.github.io/pull/4)\\n\\n## Others\\n\\n- I started Negy\'s official [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/negyio)!
