Simply put in the settings and the server you are accessing has no way of knowing who is accessing it at network level. It is based on the Tor (The Onion Routing) the most well-known method of routing concealment, and further improves ease of use and portability. Portability is the ease with which the execution environment can be moved from one to another, in other words, the ease of execution. In Negy, all components are containerised, so basically it requires only one command to launch all components. For example, it is even possible to reproduce Negy's full network in your local pc using the command docker-compose. Portability is very important in the long term, as it contributes to the ease of joining the network and ease of development. In addition, Negy is written in Rust, a memory-safe programming language, so unexpected runtime errors and memory vulnerabilities are essentially non-existent."),(0,r.kt)("admonition",{type:"tip"},(0,r.kt)("p",{parentName:"admonition"},"Note that Negy follows the Tor outline in its implementation and is therefore not compatible.")))}p.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
