In other words, the website has no way of knowing that you have accessed it. As it works as a proxy, no dedicated browser or software is required; it can be activated by simply configuring Negy\'s proxy in your operating system or application.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"quick-start/local-gateway":{"id":"quick-start/local-gateway","title":"Launch local gateway","description":"For more secure routing, you can set up your own gateway. This is also one-line executable, assuming you have a docker runtime environment - if you are not familiar with docker, please refer to this document. Now, execute the following command. Note that this is an interactive execution for testing purposes, but if you want to run it as a daemon, add the -d option.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"quick-start/public-gateway":{"id":"quick-start/public-gateway","title":"First try with public gateway!","description":"The gateway is the only component that knows the exact route. This means that for complete routing concealment, you should use a gateway that you control. However, here we will use a public gateway to see how Negy works. You only need to use the curl command, the rest is not necessary.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"roadmap":{"id":"roadmap","title":"Roadmap","description":"TBD","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
