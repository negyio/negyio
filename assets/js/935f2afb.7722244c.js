This section describes how each component behaves when it goes down.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"contribution/development_contribution":{"id":"contribution/development_contribution","title":"Development contribution","description":"Contributions to Negy in the form of bug fixes and feature additions are also welcome.

If the content contains security-sensitive or private information, you can contact us directly.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"What\'s Negy?","description":"There is no doubt that security on the Internet will become more important in the future. Tracking by cookies is the most popular method of tracking at the moment, but Negy believes that routing will also need to be concealed in the near future. Negy is a proxy that transparently conceals routing.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"quick-start/local-gateway":{"id":"quick-start/local-gateway","title":"Launch local gateway","description":"For more secure routing, you can set up your own gateway. This is also one-line executable, assuming you have a docker runtime environment - if you are not familiar with docker, please refer to this document. Now, execute the following command. Note that this is an interactive execution for testing purposes, but if you want to run it as a daemon, add the -d option.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"quick-start/public-gateway":{"id":"quick-start/public-gateway","title":"First try!","description":"The gateway is the only component that knows the exact route. This means that for complete routing concealment, you should use a gateway that you control. However, here we will use a public gateway to see how Negy works. You only need to use the curl command, the rest is not necessary.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"roadmap":{"id":"roadmap","title":"Roadmap","description":"2022/12","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
