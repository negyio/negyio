# Community

We have a plan to create Discord server but currently there isn't.

Currently we can discuss Negy on
- [Reddit (r/onions)](https://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/y9o0ic/negy_im_building_a_proxy_that_conceals_your/)
- [Reddit (r/rust)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/yccpoi/negy_next_generation_anonymous_internet/)
- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/negyio/negy/issues)

If you have any suggestions or questions, don't hesitate to post it!
