# Roadmap

## 2022/12

Increase stability of the Negy network. The number of nodes, currently operating at a minimum, will be increased to 30, including external contributions. We will also promote Negy and make multiple minor updates to reflect the large number of feedback. At this point, backwards compatibility will also be considered and implemented to support nodes that have not been updated.

## 2023/03

Increase the number of websites that can be viewed through the Negy network. This may involve some breaking modifications. Backward compatibility will be emphasised, but in the range below version 1.0, it is possible that these will be ignored to improve functionality. Increase contributors not only in node participation, but also in the coding aspect.

## 2023/07

Reach version 1.0. At this point, most websites can be browsed, and the protocol is implemented with far more stable system operation than ever before. Backward compatibility has also been fully taken into account, and backward compatibility will not be ignored when making breaking changes. Here, a new roadmap for version 2.0 is created and specific functional additions and improvements are drafted as issues.

## And more!

Negy is continuously improving in response to user feedback. Negy is continuously improving in response to user feedback. Negy aims to create a world where people all over the world don't have to worry about their privacy.
