# Report issues

As a Negy user, simply reporting bugs and feature improvements is also an important contribution. For example, if there is a website you cannot see, you can report it. All reports are aggregated on GitHub issues. You can create an issue [here](https://github.com/negyio/negy/issues). If the content contains security-sensitive or private information, you can [contact us](/contact) directly.
